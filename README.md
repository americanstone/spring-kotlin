# spring-kotlin
Lab solutions for Spring with Kotlin course. Also used in various _Kotlin with Spring_ presentations, including the recent _Spring Live_ virtual conference.

The talk is here, with a messed up title:

[Spring and Kotlin: A Writing Combonation)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hKXhmUeZMg]

(supposed to be _Spring and Kotlin: A Winning Combination_, but you get the idea :)
